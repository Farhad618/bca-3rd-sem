The name of PDF should be roll no_exam name_Subject_code.pdf(for a student having roll 10 and if subject of submission for CA2 is BCAC 303, then it will be 10_CA2_BCAC 303.pdf . For PCA1 it will be 10_PCA1_BCAC393.pdf ).

Copying from other students is strictly not allowed.

The name of PDF should be roll no_Subject_code.pdf(for a student having roll 10 and if subject of submission is BSCDA 303, then it will be 10_BSCDA 303.pdf).
Name the files properly. BCA students will submit 2 separate pdf files for CA2 and PCA1.(less than 2 MB each one)
BSCDA students will submit only one pdf file for CA2.(less than 2 MB).
